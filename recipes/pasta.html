  <h2>Chef John's Creamy Mushroom Pasta</h2>
  <p>This creamy mushroom pasta features hot cooked fettuccine pasta coated in a beautiful, aromatic, creamy mushroom sauce. You can use any pasta you like in this quick dish.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>8 ounces fettuccine pasta</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>¾ pound fresh white mushrooms, sliced</li>
      <li>¼ pound fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain but do not rinse pasta; transfer to a large serving bowl and keep warm.</li>
      <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir white and shiitake mushrooms in hot oil with a pinch of salt until liquid from mushrooms evaporates and mushrooms are browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir garlic into mushrooms and cook for 1 minute; pour in sherry and cook until wine is nearly evaporated. Stir in chicken stock; season with salt and black pepper. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat, and cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Pour cream into mushroom mixture, stir to combine, and simmer for 5 minutes. Mixture will foam and thicken slightly.</li>
    </ol>
