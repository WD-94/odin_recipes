Project: Website with index linking to full recipes

I created a main website and 3 more webpages containing 3 different recipes.
In this project I only used the terminal to do all the version control through git (excluding the initial creation of a new repository). 
Things I learned and practiced are:
- using git commands
- using terminal for organisation 
- creating websites and webpages
- using lists (ol,ul), linking, adding images
- not getting frustrated :-)
